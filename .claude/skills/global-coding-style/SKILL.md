name: Global Coding Style
description: Apply automated code formatting and style rules using tools like ESLint, Prettier, EditorConfig, and language-specific analyzers with consistent naming conventions, proper indentation, import organization, and pre-commit hooks for both C# and TypeScript projects. Use this skill when setting up code formatting tools (ESLint, Prettier, EditorConfig), when configuring linting rules for the project, when applying naming conventions (PascalCase for classes, camelCase for variables, etc.), when organizing imports and using statements, when setting up pre-commit hooks with Husky or lint-staged, when configuring indentation (4 spaces for C#, 2 spaces for TypeScript), when implementing DRY principles and refactoring repetitive code, when ensuring async method naming conventions (Async suffix), when organizing file structure and class members, when removing dead or commented-out code, or when applying consistent brace styles (Allman for C#, K&R for TypeScript).

# Global Coding Style

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global coding style.

## When to use this skill

- When setting up code formatting tools (ESLint, Prettier, EditorConfig)
- When configuring linting rules for the project
- When applying naming conventions (PascalCase, camelCase, snake_case)
- When organizing imports or using statements
- When setting up pre-commit hooks (Husky, lint-staged)
- When configuring indentation and spacing (tabs vs spaces)
- When writing or refactoring code to follow DRY principles
- When ensuring async method naming conventions
- When organizing file structure and class members
- When removing dead or commented-out code
- When applying consistent brace styles across the project
- When configuring TypeScript strict mode or C# analyzers
- When setting up code quality tools (SonarQube, StyleCop)
- When ensuring consistent line length limits
- When organizing code following SOLID principles
