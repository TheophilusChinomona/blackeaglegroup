name: Testing Test Writing
description: Write strategic, behavior-focused tests for core user flows and business-critical functionality with clear test names, proper mocking of external dependencies, fast execution times, and the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert). Use this skill when writing unit tests for business logic or utilities, when testing core user flows (login, checkout, registration), when creating integration tests for API endpoints or database interactions, when writing end-to-end tests with Playwright or Cypress, when mocking external dependencies (APIs, databases, file systems), when writing descriptive test names that explain behavior, when structuring tests with the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert), when testing React components with React Testing Library, when ensuring tests focus on behavior rather than implementation, when keeping unit tests fast (under 100ms), when testing async code and promises, when testing form validation and user interactions, when achieving strategic test coverage for critical paths, or when setting up testing frameworks and test runners.

# Testing Test Writing

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle testing test writing.

## When to use this skill

- When writing unit tests for business logic, utilities, or functions
- When testing core user flows (authentication, checkout, data submission)
- When creating integration tests for API endpoints or database interactions
- When writing end-to-end tests with Playwright, Cypress, or Selenium
- When mocking external dependencies (APIs, databases, third-party services)
- When writing clear, descriptive test names that explain expected behavior
- When structuring tests with the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- When testing React components with React Testing Library or Enzyme
- When ensuring tests focus on behavior rather than implementation details
- When keeping unit tests fast (target under 100ms per test)
- When testing async code, promises, or callbacks
- When testing form validation and user input handling
- When achieving strategic test coverage for critical functionality
- When setting up testing frameworks (Jest, Vitest, NUnit, xUnit)
