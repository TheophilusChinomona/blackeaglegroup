# Clarifying Questions for Services Page Redesign

Based on your idea for Services page redesign, I have some clarifying questions:

1. **Aesthetic Direction**: I see the About page uses a premium/luxury aesthetic with scroll animations. Should the Services page follow the same premium/luxury aesthetic to maintain consistency, or would you prefer a different distinctive aesthetic (e.g., industrial/utilitarian, editorial/magazine, art deco/geometric) that better represents the diverse range of services offered?

2. **Layout Approach**: Currently, services are displayed in a simple 3-column grid. I'm thinking we could use a more dynamic layout - perhaps a masonry grid, featured services section with larger cards, or an asymmetric layout with varying card sizes. Should we keep the uniform grid, or explore a more dynamic layout that creates visual interest?

3. **Service Card Presentation**: The current ServiceCard component has a hover parallax effect. Should we enhance this with more sophisticated interactions (e.g., expandable cards, overlay information on hover, category grouping), or keep the card structure simple but elevate the visual design?

4. **Typography & Visual Hierarchy**: Should we use the same typography system as the About page (Playfair Display for headings, Source Sans 3 for body), or introduce distinctive typography choices that differentiate the Services page while maintaining brand consistency?

5. **Color & Theme**: I'm assuming we'll use the existing brand colors (primary green #59B200, accent gold #C9A962, charcoal #2D2D2D, cream #F5F3EF). Should we introduce service category color coding or maintain a unified color palette across all services?

6. **Animation & Motion**: The frontend-design skill emphasizes high-impact moments with scroll-triggered animations. Should we implement staggered reveals for service cards as they scroll into view (similar to About page), or focus on hover interactions and micro-animations?

7. **Service Grouping/Categorization**: With 17 services, should we group them by category (e.g., Security Services, Property Services, Business Services) with section headers, or present them all in a unified grid/list without categorization?

8. **Visual Details & Atmosphere**: The frontend-design skill emphasizes backgrounds, textures, and visual details. Should we add background effects (gradient meshes, subtle patterns, decorative elements) to create depth, or keep the background clean and let the service cards be the focus?

**Existing Code Reuse:**
Are there existing features in your codebase with similar patterns we should reference? For example:
- Similar interface elements or UI components to re-use
- Comparable page layouts or navigation patterns
- Related backend logic or service objects
- Existing models or controllers with similar functionality

Please provide file/folder paths or names of these features if they exist.

**Visual Assets Request:**
Do you have any design mockups, wireframes, or screenshots that could help guide the development?

If yes, please place them in: `agent-os/specs/2026-01-01-services-page-redesign/planning/visuals/`

Use descriptive file names like:
- services-page-mockup.png
- service-card-wireframe.jpg
- lofi-services-layout.png
- mobile-view.png
- existing-ui-screenshot.png

Please answer the questions above and let me know if you've added any visual files or can point to similar existing features.
