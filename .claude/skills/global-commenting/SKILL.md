name: Global Commenting
description: Write self-documenting code first, then add minimal helpful comments only when necessary to explain business logic, non-obvious solutions, workarounds, or complex algorithms while avoiding obvious comments and keeping all comments evergreen and timeless. Use this skill when writing code with clear variable and function names, when deciding whether comments are necessary, when documenting business logic or business rules, when explaining non-obvious technical solutions, when documenting workarounds or browser-specific hacks, when linking to external resources or documentation, when writing function documentation (JSDoc, XML comments, docstrings), when commenting complex algorithms or formulas, when reviewing code to remove obvious or outdated comments, when ensuring comments explain WHY not WHAT, when avoiding TODO/FIXME/HACK comments in production code, or when refactoring code to be more self-explanatory.

# Global Commenting

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle global commenting.

## When to use this skill

- When writing code with clear, self-documenting variable and function names
- When deciding whether a comment is necessary or helpful
- When documenting business logic, business rules, or requirements
- When explaining non-obvious technical solutions or implementation choices
- When documenting workarounds, browser-specific issues, or platform limitations
- When linking to external resources, documentation, or specifications
- When writing function documentation (JSDoc, XML comments, Python docstrings)
- When commenting complex algorithms, formulas, or calculations
- When reviewing code to remove obvious, redundant, or outdated comments
- When ensuring comments explain WHY something is done, not WHAT is being done
- When avoiding TODO, FIXME, or HACK comments in committed code
- When refactoring code to make it more self-explanatory
- When commenting large sections of logic to provide high-level overview
