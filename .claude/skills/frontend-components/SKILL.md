name: Frontend Components
description: Design and build reusable, maintainable UI components following single responsibility principle, composability patterns, and clear prop interfaces with proper encapsulation and minimal coupling. Use this skill when creating new React, Vue, or other framework components, when designing component prop interfaces, when implementing component composition patterns, when managing component state locally or lifting it up, when breaking down large components into smaller focused pieces, when creating reusable utility components, when documenting component usage and props, when refactoring monolithic components into composable parts, when ensuring components have single clear purposes, or when designing component APIs with sensible defaults.

# Frontend Components

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle frontend components.

## When to use this skill

- When creating new UI components (React, Vue, Blazor, etc.)
- When designing component prop interfaces with TypeScript or PropTypes
- When implementing component composition patterns
- When managing component state (local vs lifted state)
- When breaking down large components into smaller focused components
- When creating reusable utility or shared components
- When documenting component usage, props, and examples
- When refactoring monolithic components into composable parts
- When ensuring single responsibility for each component
- When designing clear, well-documented component APIs
- When setting sensible default prop values
- When deciding between controlled vs uncontrolled components
- When keeping component props minimal and manageable
- When encapsulating component implementation details
