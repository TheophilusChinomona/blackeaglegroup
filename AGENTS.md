# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
The active React app lives in `BlackEagleGroup.React/`. Key folders:
- `BlackEagleGroup.React/src/` for application code (components, pages, hooks, utils).
- `BlackEagleGroup.React/src/assets/` for bundled assets; `BlackEagleGroup.React/public/` for static files served as-is.
- `BlackEagleGroup.React/src/test/` for Vitest test suites and setup.
- `BlackEagleGroup.React/scripts/` for build utilities (e.g., sitemap generation).
Legacy static site files are in `public_html/` and are not part of the Vite build.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Run commands from `BlackEagleGroup.React/`:
- `npm install` installs dependencies.
- `npm run dev` starts the Vite dev server with HMR.
- `npm run build` generates the sitemap and builds to `BlackEagleGroup.React/dist/`.
- `npm run preview` serves the production build locally.
- `npm run lint` runs ESLint over the codebase.
- `npm run test` runs Vitest in watch mode; `npm run test:run` runs once in CI mode.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Indentation: 2 spaces in JS/JSX and JSON files.
- Use ES modules and React function components with hooks.
- Component files use `PascalCase.jsx` (see `src/components/`), utilities in `camelCase.js` (see `src/utils/`).
- Linting: ESLint with React Hooks rules; fix lint errors before committing.
- Aliases: `@` maps to `BlackEagleGroup.React/src/` (see `vite.config.js`).

## Testing Guidelines
- Frameworks: Vitest + Testing Library with `jsdom`.
- Tests live in `BlackEagleGroup.React/src/test/` and follow `*.test.js` or `*.test.jsx`.
- Shared setup is in `BlackEagleGroup.React/src/test/setup.js`.
- Prefer focused unit and integration tests for components and routing changes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Current history uses short, lower-case summaries (e.g., “updated codebase”); keep messages concise and specific.
- PRs should describe the change, include testing performed, and attach screenshots for UI updates when applicable.
- Link related issues or tasks if they exist.

## Configuration & Deployment Notes
- The sitemap is generated by `BlackEagleGroup.React/scripts/generate-sitemap.js` during `npm run build`.
- Static legacy assets in `public_html/` should be updated separately from the React app.
