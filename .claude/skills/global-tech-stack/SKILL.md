name: Global Tech Stack
description: Understand and apply the project's technology stack including C# .NET for backend, Blazor for internal portals, React for external web apps, React Native for mobile, Azure cloud infrastructure, SQL Server databases, Entity Framework Core ORM, and Azure DevOps for CI/CD. Use this skill when choosing technologies for new features or projects, when setting up backend APIs with ASP.NET Core, when creating Blazor applications for internal tools, when building React applications for external users, when developing React Native mobile apps, when configuring Azure cloud services (App Service, SQL Database, Key Vault), when working with Entity Framework Core and database models, when setting up Azure DevOps pipelines, when configuring Docker containers or Kubernetes, when implementing authentication with JWT or Azure AD, when selecting appropriate UI frameworks (Fluent UI for Blazor, Tailwind for React), or when setting up testing frameworks (NUnit, Vitest, Playwright).
