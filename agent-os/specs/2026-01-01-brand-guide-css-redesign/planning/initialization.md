## Initial Description

The user wants to use the brand guide and sample clients page design to redesign the CSS of all components throughout the application.

Referenced brand guide documents:
- `agent-os/product/brand guide/Boilerplate code.md` - Contains Tailwind CSS configuration and HTML boilerplate with brand colors (Deep Forest #1A1C19, Vibrant Green #4B9400, Brass/Gold #C5A367, Antique White #F9F7F2)
- `agent-os/product/brand guide/Follow this to redesign the css all of components.md` - Contains comprehensive design system documentation with typography, color palette, UI components, spacing and layout guidelines
- `agent-os/product/brand guide/Design System.md` - Contains global styles (index.css), Tailwind configuration, and reusable component patterns

The user mentioned they will attach visual design assets as well.

## Goal
Apply the established brand guide (luxury corporate aesthetic with serif typography, sophisticated color palette, and premium industrial feel) consistently across all components in the React application.
