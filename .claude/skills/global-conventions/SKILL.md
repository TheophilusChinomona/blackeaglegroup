name: Global Conventions
description: Follow consistent project structure, version control practices, environment configuration, dependency management, and code review processes across the team with clear documentation and feature flags. Use this skill when organizing project files and directory structure, when writing or updating README files with setup instructions, when creating commit messages and pull requests, when configuring environment variables and secrets management, when managing project dependencies (npm, NuGet, pip), when setting up code review processes and guidelines, when defining testing requirements before merging, when implementing feature flags for incomplete features, when maintaining changelogs or release notes, when establishing branching strategies (feature branches, trunk-based development), when documenting architecture decisions, or when setting up CI/CD pipelines.

- When writing pull request descriptions
- When configuring environment variables and managing secrets
- When managing project dependencies (package.json, requirements.txt, .csproj)
- When setting up code review processes and review guidelines
- When defining testing requirements before merging code
- When implementing feature flags for incomplete or experimental features
- When maintaining changelogs or release notes
- When establishing branching strategies (Git Flow, GitHub Flow, trunk-based)
- When documenting architecture decisions or technical choices
- When setting up CI/CD pipelines or deployment workflows
- When organizing monorepo structures or multi-project solutions
