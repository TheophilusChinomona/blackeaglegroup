name: Backend API
description: Design and implement RESTful API endpoints following enterprise best practices including proper HTTP methods, status codes, versioning, and URL structure. Use this skill when creating or modifying API controllers, when designing endpoint routes and URL patterns, when implementing HTTP request handlers (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE), when adding API versioning strategies, when structuring API responses with proper status codes, when working with query parameters for filtering and pagination, when implementing rate limiting, or when documenting API endpoints with Swagger/OpenAPI.

# Backend API

This Skill provides Claude Code with specific guidance on how to adhere to coding standards as they relate to how it should handle backend API.

## When to use this skill

- When creating new API controllers or endpoints
- When modifying existing API routes or handlers
- When implementing RESTful resource-based URLs
- When working with HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- When adding API versioning (URL path or header-based)
- When structuring API responses and status codes
- When implementing query parameters for filtering, sorting, or pagination
- When adding rate limiting or throttling to endpoints
- When documenting APIs with Swagger/OpenAPI specifications
- When designing nested resource endpoints
- When implementing consistent error responses across API endpoints
